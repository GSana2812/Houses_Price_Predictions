# Houses_Price_Predictions
Existing Boston House Price Prediction modularized and structured

In the [Traditional ML](https://github.com/GSana2812/Traditional_ML) repository I created a simple notebook predicting the prices of houses in Boston. In this project, I structured the code around Classes and functions, so it can be more readable and reusable for future purposes.

The classes created:

1. DataPreprocessor -> applies preprocessing procedures such as imputing missing values, removing duplicates, removing outliers and scaling the features.
2. LinearRegression -> linear regression algorithm implemented from scratch, with all its necessary methods and functionalities. In the end several metrics are used such as mean squared error, mean absolute error and r-squared error.
3. ModelEvaluator -> creates two charts, bar chart and scatter plot containing also the regression line, to visualize the results.
